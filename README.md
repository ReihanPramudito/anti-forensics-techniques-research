# Anti-Forensics Techniques Research 

## 📖 **Overview**  
- 🎯 **Objective**: *Demonstrate four anti‑forensic techniques—artifact wiping (`Eraser`), evidence hiding (`VeraCrypt`), trail obfuscation (`Scapy`), and tool attacks (`UPX`)—and assess their legal status under Indonesian ITE (Art. 32) and KUHP/Criminal Code (Art. 278)*
- 📝 **Key Steps**:
  - *Implement and test each technique (e.g., hidden volumes with VeraCrypt, IP spoofing with Scapy)*
  - *Evaluate the recoverability, complexity, and detectability of each method*
  - *Map each technique to relevant Indonesian statutes (ITE Law Art. 32, KUHP -Criminal Code- Art. 278)*
- 📊 **Key Results**:
  -  *Achieved irreversible file deletion via Eraser; created undetectable and encrypted hidden volumes in VeraCrypt; successfully spoofed test packets with Scapy; obfuscated executables with UPX to evade signature-based scans*
  -  *Identified that all four techniques constitute violations of ITE Law Article 32 and KUHP Article 278 when used maliciously*
- 📚 **Context**: *Research and test anti‑forensic methods and their legal implications*
