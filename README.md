# Anti-Forensics Techniques Research 

## 📖 **Overview**  
- 🎯 **Objective**: *Investigate and demonstrate four common anti‑forensic techniques (artifact wiping, evidence hiding, trail obfuscation, and attacks on forensic tools) using practical methods and tools, then analyse their legal implications under Indonesian law.*
- 📝 **Key Steps**:
  - *Implement and test each technique (e.g., hidden volumes with VeraCrypt, IP spoofing with Scapy)*
  - *Evaluate the recoverability, complexity, and detectability of each method*
  - *Map each technique to relevant Indonesian statutes (ITE Law Art. 32, KUHP -Criminal Code- Art. 278)*
- 📊 **Key Results**:
  -  *Achieved irreversible file deletion via Eraser; created undetectable and encrypted hidden volumes in VeraCrypt; successfully spoofed test packets with Scapy; obfuscated executables with UPX to evade signature-based scans*
  -  *Identified that all four techniques constitute violations of ITE Law Article 32 and KUHP Article 278 when used maliciously*
- 📚 **Context**: *Research and test anti‑forensic methods and their legal implications*
